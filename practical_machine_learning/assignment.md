# Practical Machine Learning Assignment (Coursera)

## Objective
In this project data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants was used to predict the manner in which they did the exercise (the "classe" variable). A R Markdown describes the whole model development, from the data cleaning and pre-processing until the tests.

## Peer Review Portion
The assignment submission will be reviewed by other students. The submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with the markdown and compiled HTML file describing the analysis.

## Warning
Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, the code should not be run by any classmate.
