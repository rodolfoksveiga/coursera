Differences between GET and POST

GET
    Parameters in URL
    User for fetching documents
    Maximum URL length
    Okay to cache
    Not okay to change the server

POST
    Parameters in body
    User for updating data
    No max length
    Not okay to cache
    Okay to change the server

Anything that changes the server should be done as a POST, you should use POST forms, and not GET links to do permanent actions on the server, though
